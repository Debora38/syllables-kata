# Haiku kata

Haikus are short poems in a three-line format, with 17 syllables arranged in a 5–7–5 pattern. Your task is to check if the supplied text is a haiku or not.

### About syllables
Syllables are the phonological building blocks of words. In this kata, a syllable is a part of a word including a vowel (_"a-e-i-o-u-y"_) or a group of vowels (e.g. _"ou", "ee", "ay"_). A few examples: _"tea", "can", "to·day", "week·end", "el·e·phant"._

However, silent "E"s do not create syllables. In this kata, an "E" is considered silent if it's alone at the end of the word, preceded by one (or more) consonant(s) and there is at least one other syllable in the word. _Examples: "age", "ar·range", "con·crete"; but not in "she", "blue", "de·gree"._

#### Some more examples:

- one syllable words: _"cat", "cool", "sprout", "like", "eye", "squeeze"_
- two syllables words: _"ac·count", "hon·est", "beau·ty", "a·live", "be·cause", "re·store"_
